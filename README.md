# Kotlin app - Motion and Position Sensors

A Kotlin script to obtain data from the smartphone Motion and Position sensors.

It can get sensor data from ACCELEROMETER, GYROSCOPE, ROTATION_VECTOR sensors.
The values are updated every time the sensor changes its value and are displayed
on the smartphone's screen. If you don't have any of the sensors, the app will
show a message "Sensor not available" on the correspondent textView.
